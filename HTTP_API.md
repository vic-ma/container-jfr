### Core

* #### `AuthPostHandler`

    ###### synopsis
    Attempts user authentication;
    used as a simple way to check a user authentication header.

    ###### request
    `POST /api/v1/auth`

    The request should include an `Authorization` header to be checked.
    The format of this header depends on the auth manager used.
    Token-based auth managers expect `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN`,
    while basic credentials-based auth managers expect
    `Authorization: Basic ${base64(user:pass)}`.
    The `NoopAuthManager` accepts all authentication requests,
    regardless of the existence or contents of any
    `Authorization` header.
    For more details, see
    [`README.md`](https://github.com/rh-jmc-team/container-jfr#user-authentication--authorization)).

    ###### response
    `200` - No body. Getting this response means that the header is valid
    and that the user has been successfully authenticated.

    `401` - User authentication failed. The body is an error message.
    There will be an `X-WWW-Authenticate: $SCHEME` header that indicates
    the authentication scheme that is used.
    Getting this response means that the header has an invalid format
    or the user has not been successfully authenticated.

    `500` - There was an unexpected error. The body is an error message.

    ###### example
    ```
    $ curl -X POST --header "Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzCg==" localhost:8181/api/v1/auth
    ```


* #### `ClientUrlGetHandler`

    ###### synopsis
    Returns a URL that a client can connect to, to access Container JFR's
    WebSocket command channel (see [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md)).

    ###### request
    `GET /api/v1/clienturl`

    ###### response
    `200` - The body is `{"clientUrl":"$URL"}`.

    `500` - The URL could not be constructed due to an error with the socket
    or the host. Or there was an unexpected error. The body is an error message.

    ###### example
    ```
    $ curl localhost:8181/api/v1/clienturl
    {"clientUrl":"ws://0.0.0.0:8181/api/v1/command"}
    ```


* #### `GrafanaDashboardUrlGetHandler`

    ###### synopsis
    Returns the URL of the Grafana dashboard that Container JFR
    is configured with (determined by the environment variable
    `GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_URL`).

    ###### request
    `GET /api/v1/grafana_dashboard_url`

    ###### response
    `200` - The body is `{"grafanaDashboardUrl":"$URL"}`.

    `500` - Container JFR is not configured with a Grafana dashboard.
    Or there was an unexpected error. The body is an error message.

    ###### example
    ```
    $ curl localhost:8181/api/v1/grafana_dashboard_url
    {"grafanaDashboardUrl":"http://localhost:3000/d/CazTnbSMz/"}
    ```


* #### `GrafanaDatasourceUrlGetHandler`

    ###### synopsis
    Returns the URL of the Grafana datasource that Container JFR
    is configured with (determined by the environment variable
    `GRAFANA_DATASOURCE_URL`).

    ###### request
    `GET /api/v1/grafana_datasource_url`

    ###### response
    `200` - The body is `{"grafanaDatasourceUrl":"$URL"}`

    `500` - Container JFR is not configured with a Grafana datasource.
    Or there was an unexpected error. The body is an error message.

    ###### example
    ```
    $ curl localhost:8181/api/v1/grafana_datasource_url
    {"grafanaDatasourceUrl":"http://localhost:8080"}
    ```


* #### `HealthGetHandler`

    ###### synopsis
    Returns whether or not the Grafana datasource and Grafana dashboard
    that Container JFR is configured with are running properly.
    Can also be used to see if Container JFR itself is running properly,
    by checking for a valid response.

    ###### request
    `GET /health`

    ###### response
    `200` - The body is
    `{"datasourceAvailable":$DATASOURCE_AVAILABLE,"dashboardAvailable":$DASHBOARD_AVAILABLE}`.

    `$DATASOURCE_AVAILABLE` is `true` if  Container JFR is configured with a
    Grafana datasource and that datasource responds to a `GET` request
    with a `200`, and it is `false` otherwise.

    `$DASHBOARD_AVAILABLE` is `true` if  Container JFR is configured with a
    Grafana dashboard and that dashboard responds to a `GET` request
    with a `200`, and it is `false` otherwise.

    `500` - There was an unexpected error. The body is an error message.

    `GET /*`

    The path should be the directory path of the desired asset,
    assuming a root of
    `target/assets/app/resources/com/redhat/rhjmc/containerjfr/net/web/`.

    ###### response

    `200` - The body is the requested asset. Note that if the requested asset
    does not exist or the path is invalid, the request will not be handled here
    and instead  will be routed to
    [`WebClientAssetsGetHandler`](#WebClientAssetsGetHandler).

    `500` - There was an unexpected error. The body is an error message.

    ###### example
    ```
    $ curl localhost:8181/images/pfbg_992@2x.jpg --output pfbg_992@2x.jpg
      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

    Uploads a recording from the client to Container JFR's archive.

    ###### request
    `POST /api/v1/recordings`

    The recording should be uploaded in a form with the name `recording`.
    The filename of the recording must be in the following format, which is
    the same format that Container JFR uses for recordings it saves itself
    (all fields in brackets are optional):
    ```
    [$TARGET_NAME]_[$RECORDING_NAME]_[$DATE]T[$TIME]Z[.$COUNTER][.jfr]
    ```

    `TARGET_NAME` - The name of the target JVM (alphanumerics and hyphens allowed)

    `DATE` - The date of the recording (numbers allowed)

    `TIME` - The time of the recording (numbers allowed)

    `COUNTER` - An additional number used to avoid name collisions
    (numbers allowed)

    Formally, the required format is:
    ```
    ([A-Za-z\d-]*)_([A-Za-z\d-_]*)_([\d]*T[\d]*Z)(\.[\d]+)?(\.jfr)?
    ```

    ###### response
    `200` - The body is `{"name":"$NAME"}`, where `$NAME` is the name of the
    recording that is now saved in archive.
    This name may be different from the filename of the uploaded file
    for two reasons.

    First, if there is a name collision, a counter will be added to the
    original filename, or the existing counter will be modified,
    and the new counter will be set to the next available number,
    starting from `2`. A counter of `1` will be removed if there is no
    name conflict, and modified to the next available number if there is.

    And second, if the filename of the uploaded file does not include a `.jfr`
    ending, one will be added.

    `400` - The recording submission is invalid. The body is an error
    message.

    `401` - User authentication failed. The body is an error message.
    There will be an `X-WWW-Authenticate: $SCHEME` header that indicates
    the authentication scheme that is used.

    `427` - JMX authentication failed. The body is an error message.
    There will be an `X-JMX-Authenticate: $SCHEME` header that indicates
    the authentication scheme that is used.

    `500` - There was an unexpected error. The body is an error message.

    `503` - `CONTAINER_JFR_ARCHIVE_PATH` is an invalid directory.
    The body is an error message.

    ###### example
    ```
    $ curl --form "recording=@localhost_foo_20200903T202547Z.jfr" localhost:8181/api/v1/recordings
    {"name":"localhost_foo_20200903T202547Z.2.jfr"}
